# What it is

Learning Python using tweepy and twitter API to automate twitter functions. Most of the other examples I've seen online were reading and writing from files, however, in my opinion Redis database is as easy to use and integrates well with Python. Redis also lowers CPU storage space, especially while doing the sentiment analysis which can download thousands of tweets. For more reliable 24/7 running, I built this script into a Docker container.
